When to use which sorting algorithm

Insertion Sort
With few data or when data is mostly sorted

Bubble Sort 
Never gonna use it just for educational purpose

Selection Sort 
Never Gonna use it Just for educational purpose

Merge Sort 
Use when when worried about first case
Maybe for  process outside memory

Quick Sort
Better than merge sort sme time complexity but better space complexity
but if you are worried about worsst case then use something else
