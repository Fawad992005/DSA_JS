Breadt Fist Seacrh
Time Complexity O(n)
Very good for finding the shortest path
If you have Addtional info about the target node that it is on the upper level of tree than BFS is better


It requires more memory then DFS


Depth First Search 
Time  Complexity O(n)
If you have Addtional info about the target node that it is on the lower level of tree than DFS is better
Requires less memory than BFS
It can get slow if tree or graph are very deep and it is not good at finding the shortest path
Good for finding if a path exists between two nodes
