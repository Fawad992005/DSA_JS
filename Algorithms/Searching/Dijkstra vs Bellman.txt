Bellman Ford Algorithm

Very efficient at solving the shortest path over Dijkstra algorihtm if a weighted graph has negative weigh or negative number then Bellman can solve it but Dijkstra can't
Can take a long time 
Wase time complexity O(n)

Dijkstra Algorithm
A little bit faster
But cant accomodate negative numbers
